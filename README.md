<h1 align="center">DSM Occlusion</h1>
<h3 align="center">Fast, ray-traced, occlusion for raster models</h3>

![DSM Occlusion example](/assets/banner.jpg)

<br>
<h2 align="center">Key features</h2>

 - **GPU accelerated**  
   Using CUDA reduces the computation time by order of magnitudes compared to other programs.
 - **Automated tiling**  
   Large files are automatically split into tiles, with configurable size and margins (buffers to avoid border effects).
 - **Handles large models**  
   Given enough disk space, can process files of several terabytes.
 - **Ray-traced rendering**  
   Occlusion is computed using ray-tracing, simulating the real behavior of light rays.

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

This software requires a computer with an Nvidia graphic card and its driver installed.  
Supported operating systems are Windows and Linux.

### Windows

1. Download the [release](https://github.com/Dolpic/DSM-Occlusion/releases/tag/latest-main)  from this repository and run the executable contained in it from a command line.

### Linux

1. Install GDAL for your distribution. The package is generally named *gdal* or *libgdal*.

2. Download the release [for latest CUDA](https://github.com/Dolpic/DSM-Occlusion/releases/tag/latest-main) or [for CUDA 11](https://github.com/Dolpic/DSM-Occlusion/releases/tag/cuda-11) from this repository and run the executable contained in it from a command line.

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

- ***-i inputFile***  
*mandatory parameter*  
Path to the input file. Must be a file supported by GDAL like .tif

- ***-o outputFile***  
*optional parameter*, default value : output.tif   
Path to the output file, where the result will be written

- ***-r raysPerPixel***  
*optional parameter*, default value : 1024   
Number of rays to launch for each pixel. Increasing the parameter decreases the noise and increases the render quality and rendering time.  
  - ~256 = low quality (noise is very noticeable)
  - ~1024 = medium quality (noise is noticeable, but limited)
  - ~2048 = high quality (noise is almost not noticeable)

- ***-t tileSize***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 2000, in pixels   
The input file is processed in square tiles. This parameter controls the tile side length.  
Smaller tiles are computed faster, but lead to a larger buffer surface (see next parameter) and may create border error if the buffers are not large enough.  
Larger tiles are more computation heavy for the GPU.  
The optimal value for this parameter strongly depends on your graphic card, don't hesitate to try multiple sizes.

- ***-b tileBuffer***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 1/3 of the tile size, in pixels   
The input file is processed in square tiles. To avoid border error, tiles are overlapping. This parameter controls the tile overlapping amount (in pixels) in each direction. 

- ***-e exaggeration***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 1.0   
This parameter scales all input values by the given factor. A value higher than 1.0 makes the shadows darker, revealing more details. 

- ***-B maximumBounces***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 0    
The maximum number of times a ray can bounce on the geometry before the ray is considered not reaching the sky.
The higher the value, the more accurate and luminous the result will be. *Increase this value will drastically increase the processing time!*. A value of 0 (the default) leads to the same result as computing the sky view factor.

- ***--bias biasValue***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 1.0   
Bias applied to rays distribution. A value of 1 means no bias, and the rays are uniformly sampled in all directions.
Values greater than 1 : bias rays toward the horizon, revealing small terrain details but darkening already occluded areas.
Values smaller than 1 : bias rays toward the zenith, brightening dark areas and discarding terrain details.

- ***--ambientPower power***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 0   
Ambient luminosity, applied to every pixel, as if every pixel is receives some amount of light.

- ***--skyPower power***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 1   
Uniform power distributed over the whole sky. Simulates a light coming from every direction of the sky.

- ***--sunPower power***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 0   
Power of the sun. Simulates a sun in the sky casting light in all directions

- ***--sunAzimuth angle***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 0   
Azimuth of the sun's position in the sky, in degrees. The value is between 0 and 360, clockwise.

- ***--sunElevation angle***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 45   
Elevation of the sun's position in the sky, in degrees. The value is between 0 and 90. Zero is at the zenith, 90 is at the horizon.

- ***--sunAngularDiam angle***   
*optional parameter*, default value : 11.4
Angular diameter covered by the sun in the sky, in degree. The value is between 0 and 180. Near zero the sun is a single dot in the sky, near 180 it covers the whole hemisphere. 

- ***--tiled***   
*optional parameter*   
Instead of creating one output file and writing everything at once inside it, creates the folder *./output_tiles* and render each tile separately inside it. This is especially usefull when rendering very large files. If this options is enabled, the option *-o* is ignored.

- ***--startTile tileId***    
*optional parameter*, default value : 0   
Id of the first tile to be processed. All tiles before it will be ignored and not rendered. This is usefull combined with the *--tiled* options to resume a render at a given tile.

- ***--outputByte***   
*optional parameter*, only works with ***--tiled***
The saved tiles have their values rescaled between 0 and 255 and saved as Byte datatype. This generates tiles that take less disk space than in Float32, which is the default.

- ***--info***    
*optional parameter*   
Prints information about the GDAL driver and the graphic card. This is purely informative. 

Example : `DSM_Occlusion -i /path/to/input.tif -o /path/to/output.tif -r 1024`

### macOS

- macOS is currently not supported. Contributions are welcome !

#### Troubleshooting

- ***Unable to find GDAL library*** during build  
*Reason* : The GDAL library files (.lib on Windows, or .so on Linux) failed to be located.  
*Solution* : Make sure GDAL is installed properly. If GDAL library is not installed in the expected directory (*/usr/lib/* on Linux, or *C:/OSGeo4W/lib/* on Windows) you can specify GDAL library location by defining GDAL_LIB_DIR during CMake generation. Example : `cmake -B ./build -DGDAL_LIB_DIR=<your_gdal_path>`

- ***gdal_priv.h not found*** during build  
*Reason* : The GDAL header files (.h) failed to be located.  
*Solution* : Make sure GDAL is installed properly. If GDAL headers are not installed in the expected directory (*/usr/include/* on Linux, or *C:/OSGeo4W/include/* on Windows) you can specify GDAL headers location by defining GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR during CMake generation. Example : `cmake -B ./build -DGDAL_INCLUDE_DIR=<your_gdal_path>`

- ***Unsupported gpu architecture*** during build  
*Reason* : By default, the project is compiled for the hardware on the current machine. This error happens if CUDA was not able to find the current machine architecture (for example, when the current machine doesn't have a GPU).  
*Solution* : You can specify the GPU architecture to use by defining CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES during generation. Example : `cmake -B ./build -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=75`. See [CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES.html).

- ***Missing CUDA driver*** or ***CUDA driver version is insufficient*** when running the executable  
*Reason* : Your CUDA driver is either missing or too old.  
*Solution* : Install the latest [CUDA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) for your system and graphic card.

- ***CUDA error = 222*** when running the executable  
*Reason* : Your CUDA toolkit installation is too old.
*Solution* : Install the latest [CUDA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) for your system and graphic card. Alternatively, you can also download the [version build with CUDA 11](https://github.com/Dolpic/DSM-Occlusion/releases/tag/cuda-11)
